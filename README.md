<h1 align="center">App that fetches (public) user gists from Github ðŸ‘‹</h1>

## Local Setup
1. Run either `npm i`, `npm install` or `yarn` to install dependancies.
2. Run `npm start` or `yarn start` to run the app.

## App that fetches (public) user gists from Github

It uses Github's [Octokit REST API](https://octokit.github.io/rest.js/v18/)

### Whats Expected
Create a list of public gist available.
* Search Gists for the username.
* Use state management to save data and not make duplicate calls.
* Show all the relevant meta data available in the response.
* We do expect you to create and use proper component hierarchy keeping service and components exclusive.8(
* Please use git version control.

### Good to have
* Proper handling of error message and no results screens.
* Clean UI similar to [this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dubizzle-onboarding/gistapi/main/design_inspiration.png).
* Unit Tests.
* Optimised rendering.
* Code comments.
* Type checking of the params.

### Thank you
We thank you for your effort and time and good luck.
